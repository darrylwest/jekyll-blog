title: PouchDb For Client Storage
---

* [rational for using](http://pouchdb.com/2014/09/22/3.0.6.html) based on cross browser bug workarounds
* document storage much better than SQL
* binary attachments to save images or gzip'd data
* change events fire when row data changes
* bulk insert/updates
* sync with other databases (local and remote)
