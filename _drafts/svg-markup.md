title: Javascript and SVG Components
---

A few months ago we bagan a new javascript graphics project called Markup that lets and instructor add simple graphic shapes, comments and audio annotations to a students digital image.  The project is a re-write of an earlier version written in Adobe Flex.  The new requirement is to provide the same functionality without the dependency on the flash player.

While researching the best technology to use I came across four potential libraries, two in canvas and two in SVG.  We finally settled on SVG using svg.js because it had much more capabilites than the canvas projects and the best object oriented implementation for SVG.  

Here are the four that were researched:

- Fabric.js - canvas
- Kinetics - canvas
- Raphael - svg
- svg.js - svg
