title: A Common Service Library for Node
---
All of our applications devide web front end development and delivery from the back end, REST only services.  Components common to all REST services including bootstrap, factories, validation delegates and services are contained in a set available through npm called node-service-commons.

The commons are complete enough to provide many components and flexible enough to allow other modules for logging, database, etc.
